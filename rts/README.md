RTS
===

This is a fairly faithful port of a 2007 high school project for my senior
Irish Literature class. It is a real time strategy game about the Battle of
Clontarf where the player controls the Army of Brian Boru. 

This is not a demonstration of how a real time strategy game should be coded,
it is a demonstration of what is possible with PyGame for a fairly new
programmer. This code does not use best practices.

The original code was in Java, and ChatGPT was used to make a reasonably
faithful port to Python so the code is easier to use.

A few modifications have been made to allow the game to run even if assets are
not available.
